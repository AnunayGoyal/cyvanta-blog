The Evolution of Botnets

Traditional DDoS attacks rely on sheer volume. They flood a target with UDP packets until the pipes burst.
But **AI-driven botnets** are different. They are surgical.

### Smart Targeting

Instead of hitting the firewall, they analyze the target's response times to identify **expensive queries**—database searches that take 500ms+ to execute.

"The goal isn't to crash the network. It's to exhaust the CPU."

### Code Analysis

Here is a Python snippet showing how a basic anomaly detection system might flag these requests:

<CodeWindow title="script.py" lang="python">
{`import numpy as np

def detect_anomaly(latency_array):
    # Calculate dynamic threshold based on standard deviation
    threshold = np.mean(latency_array) + (3 * np.std(latency_array))
    anomalies = []
    
    for val in latency_array:
        if val > threshold:
            anomalies.append(val)
            
    return anomalies`}
</CodeWindow>

This script looks for outliers that statistically deviate from the baseline latency, flagging potential AI-coordinated pulses.

# The Evolution of Botnets

Traditional DDoS attacks rely on sheer volume. They flood a target with UDP packets until the pipes burst. But **AI-driven botnets** are different. They are surgical.

## Smart Targeting

Instead of hitting the firewall, they analyze the target's response times to identify **expensive queries**—database searches that take 500ms+ to execute.

### Code Analysis

Here is a Python snippet showing how a basic anomaly detection system might flag these requests:

```python
def detect_anomaly(latency_array):
    threshold = np.mean(latency_array) + (3 * np.std(latency_array))
    anomalies = []
    
    for val in latency_array:
        if val > threshold:
            anomalies.append(val)
    return anomalies

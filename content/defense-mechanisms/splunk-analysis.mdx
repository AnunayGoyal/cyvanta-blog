The most dangerous phase of a breach isn't the entry—it's the **Lateral Movement**. 
Once inside, adversaries use legitimate credentials to hop between servers.

Detecting this requires correlating **Event ID 4624** (Login) with network anomalies.

### Technical Analysis

The following logic was deployed to flag this activity:

<CodeWindow title="query.spl" lang="SPLUNK SPL">
{`// Correlate Failed Logins with Successful Admin Access
index=windows source="WinEventLog:Security"
| where EventCode=4625 OR EventCode=4624
| stats count(eval(EventCode=4625)) as Failures,
  count(eval(EventCode=4624)) as Success by TargetAccount, IpAddress

// Filter for Brute Force followed by Entry
| where Failures > 10 AND Success > 0
| sort - Failures
| table TargetAccount, IpAddress, Failures, Success`}
</CodeWindow>

By tracking the ratio of failures to success on high-value accounts, we can detect an adversary forcing their way into the Domain Controller.
